# Final-Project-BCOG200
The idea for my final project is to make code that randomly generates different poems from a specific poet. The idea of coding a specific poet's poetry really interests me. Is it ethical to take on a poet's style and make a poem from them through code? Will it sound anything like the poet? What are the different tools you can use to create poetry that follows rhythm,or is sound syntactically and/or semantically? Can you make meaningful poetry through code?
